Pinyin Tone Converter
=====================

This repository will contain a ruby class thingy (PinyinToneConverter) that converts pinyin numbered tones (i.e., something like "zhong1 wen2") to the UTF-8 equivalent with tone diacritical marks (like "zhōngwén") and back.

Also, tests to make sure it works.  Because everybody likes well-tested code.

# Notes on Special Characters

The class should support any of the various standard forms of ü for input (ü or u: or v) and produce double-diacritic forms of those characters for tones (ǖ, ǘ, ǚ, ǜ).

Probably the Apache2 License.  I'll get around to setting that up properly at some point here.
