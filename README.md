Pinyin Tone Converter
=====================

This repository will contain a ruby class thingy (PinyinToneConverter) that converts pinyin numbered tones (i.e., something like "zhong1 wen2") to the UTF-8 equivalent with tone diacritical marks (like "zhōngwén") and back.

Also, tests to make sure it works.  Because everybody likes well-tested code.

The class should support any of the various standard forms of ü in input; ü or u: or v.
