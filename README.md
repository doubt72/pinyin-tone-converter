# Pinyin Tone Converter

This repository contains a simple ruby class (PinyinToneConverter) that converts pinyin numbered tones (i.e., something like "zhong1 wen2") to the UTF-8 equivalent with tone diacritical marks (like "zhōngwén") and back.

## Usage

[TODO: Docs on wrapper script]

[TODO: Docs on class methods go here]

### Notes

* The class should support any of the various standard forms of ü for input (ü or u: or v) and produce double-diacritic forms of those characters for tones (ǖ, ǘ, ǚ, ǜ).

## Tests

Also, tests to make sure it works.  Because everybody likes well-tested code.
